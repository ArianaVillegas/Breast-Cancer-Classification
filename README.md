# Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification

In this project, we are required to implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify information from a database of breast cancer patients from the University of Wisconsin. The dataset contains information obtained from mammography images of a group of women, some of whom have a malignant tumor and others have a benign tumor.

The objective of this project is to implement an MLP neural network in teams of 3 people, which will be trained to predict whether a new patient has a cancerous tumor or not. Additionally, we will conduct tests and experiments by varying the hyperparameters and activation functions.

The dataset contains information on 569 patients, of which 357 have a benign tumor and the remaining 212 patients have malignant breast tumors. The first column of the dataset represents the patient's ID, the second column is a letter (M = Malignant, B = Benign) representing the diagnosis, and the next 30 fields are values representing measurements and characteristics of the tumor or cyst obtained through digital image processing.
